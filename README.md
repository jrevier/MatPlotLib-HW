# Observations
1. Average tumor size and mouse weight for mice on Capomulin seem to be positively correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0.84. 
2. Ramicane and Capomulin are amongst the two most successful drugs and also have the most data points. This may be because mice were able to survive for a longer time due to the effectiveness of the drugs. 
3. These two drugs also had the smallest variance between average tumor size which indicates that they are more reliably successful at reducing tumor size in mice.
